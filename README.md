The idea of this github is to put together the main documents and our code in order to answer our question : how to predict the readmission of diabetic patients ?
To do that, we use differents methods : 

-	Methods to reduce the dimensionality of our large dataset, by transforming the large set of variables into a smaller one that still contains most of the information in the large set.
-	Data visualisation
-	Classification metrics

We will try to go in depth of our problematic, and see what unexpected factors of readmission there could be.
