The idea of this github is to put together the main documents and our code in order to answer our question : how to predict the readmission of diabetic patients?
To do that, we use differents methods :  
-	PCA to reduce the dimensionality of large data sets, by transforming a large set of variables into a smaller one that still contains most of the information in the large set.
-	Data visualisation
-	Classification metrics
